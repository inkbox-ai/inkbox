# Changelog

## 0.4.3

### Breaking

- **`inkbox identity unlink-phone <handle>` was renamed to `inkbox identity release-phone <handle>`** and now releases the number at the carrier in addition to detaching it from the identity. Previously it only cleared the FK and left the carrier-side number live. There is no "unlink without release" path anymore.
- **`inkbox identity assign-phone` was removed.** The server no longer supports cross-identity reassignment; phone numbers are bound to the identity they were provisioned on. To attach a number, create the identity first with `inkbox identity create <handle>`, then run `inkbox number provision --handle <handle>`.
